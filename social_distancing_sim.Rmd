### Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) Model
```{r}
param = param.dcm(inf.prob = 0.1, 
                  act.rate = 1, 
                  rec.rate = 0.05,
                  a.rate = 0, 
                  ds.rate = 0, di.rate = 0.01, dr.rate = 0)
# focus on act.rate
# by social distancing, try to decrease that number
```
set the initial parameter of the population with 10,000 susceptible people, with 10 infected, and 0 recovered.
```{r}
init = init.dcm(s.num = 10000, i.num = 10, r.num = 0)
```

set the controls for the "Deterministic Compartmental Model"
```{r}
control = control.dcm(type = "SIR", nsteps = 1000, dt = 0.5)
```

run the simulation with the specified model parameters
```{r}
model = dcm(param, init, control)
model.df = as.data.frame(model)
head(model.df)
```
